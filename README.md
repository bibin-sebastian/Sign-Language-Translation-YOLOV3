# Sign-Language-Translation-YOLOV3
This project was aimed at a course work themed 'making smarter cities' . We proposed that no city can be truly smart without being inclusive and focused on deaf and mute community.
Major work was related to the generation of annotated dataset. I have enclosed a short code that will generate a bounding box on the screen
while generating the dataset, input the letter for which images and annotation need to be generated . The bounding box will move slowly to 
capture different areas of the screen, caputure the image and create the annotation text file. This trick was due to the fact that I did not have much time to spend on creating the dataset.
